# SilverSpoon (previously FitGirlDownloader)

> **Note:** Currently supports `fuckingfast.co` and `datanodes.to` links (commonly used by FitGirl Repacks and direct download mirrors). Support for additional hosts may be added in the future.

A Python-based bulk downloader designed to bypass Cloudflare protections on file-hosting sites like *fuckingfast.co* and *datanodes.to*. It automates the process of extracting direct download links and supports concurrent downloading with pause and resume capabilities.

## Features

* **Auto-Updater:** (Windows only) Automatically checks for, downloads, and applies new updates so you are always on the latest version without manual `.zip` downloads.
* **Cross-Platform Extraction:** Built-in auto-extraction support for Windows (bundled `7z`), as well as Linux and macOS (via `/usr/bin/7z` / `p7zip`).
* **Cloudflare Turnstile Bypass:** Uses a hidden Chromium browser (via `nodriver`) to auto-solve Cloudflare Turnstile challenges invisibly, then downloads via `curl_cffi` with TLS impersonation. No manual CAPTCHA solving needed for normal IPs.
* **Persistent Download History:** Automatically saves your task queue, progress, and folder groupings across sessions. Close the app anytime without losing your place!
* **Grouped Batch Folders:** Downloads are neatly organized into collapsible dropdown trees, showing aggregated progress, speed, and ETA for entire batches.
* **Smart Folder Grouping & Batching:** Automatically suggests a unified folder name for a batch of links, perfectly grouping main game parts and messy optional files together.
* **Persistent Settings:** Your preferences (save directory, concurrent workers, extraction options) are saved and remembered for your next session.
* **Download Scheduler:** Set up scheduled download windows (weekly or one-off) for off-peak downloading, with optional Windows wake timers and sleep prevention.
* **Bandwidth Limiter:** Set a global download speed limit in Settings to reserve network bandwidth for other apps.
* **Import Links & Smart Clipboard Extraction:** Load link lists from `.txt` files or paste text/HTML directly — SilverSpoon automatically extracts valid `http` links from formatted webpage clipboard data.
* **Inline Progress Bars:** Visual progress bars painted directly behind filenames and batch folders in the queue.
* **Live Speed & ETAs:** Features a real-time global download speed tracker and calculates Estimated Time Remaining (ETA) for both individual files and total batch completions.
* **Context Menu Actions:** Right-click tasks to manually extract archives ("Extract Now"), open download directories ("Open Folder"), schedule intervals, retry, or force redownload.
* **Customizable UI & Shortcuts:** Interactive, resizable columns that save their state, responsive button feedback (hover/pressed/disabled states), plus right-click context menus and handy keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Space` to pause/resume, `Delete` to remove tasks).
* **Auto-Retry & CAPTCHA Timeout:** Configurable options to automatically retry failed downloads up to 3 times and customize Turnstile CAPTCHA wait timeouts.
* **File Management:** Safely delete tasks and optionally remove their associated physical files from your disk, or use "Force Redownload" to wipe and restart a corrupted file.
* **Error Diagnostics:** Hover over failed tasks for detailed tooltips, and easily copy error logs for quick troubleshooting.
* **Direct Link Extraction:** Automatically simulates the internal HTMX POST requests required to fetch the real `.rar` direct links.
* **Multi-threading:** Downloads multiple parts concurrently (default 3 workers, customizable in Settings) to maximize bandwidth.
* **Pause, Resume & Retry:** Safely pause your downloads, recover from network drops, or quickly retry errored links using HTTP `Range` headers.
* **Graphical Interface:** Includes a clean, modern GUI built with PyQt6.
* **Command Line Interface:** Also includes a lightweight CLI script for server environments or automation.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/billysams21/SilverSpoon.git
   cd SilverSpoon
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages (or do it inside virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Using the GUI (Recommended)
Launch the graphical interface (or double-click `SilverSpoon.exe`):
```bash
python pyqt_downloader.py
```

1. Click **Browse...** to select your base save directory (or set a persistent default in `File -> Settings`).
2. Open the game link and click the provider you want to use (for now it's FuckingFast).

3. Copy the links you want to download.

4. Paste your links into the top text box (one per line) or use `File -> Import Links from File...`. You can also copy links/tables straight from your browser and click **Paste from Clipboard**—SilverSpoon automatically extracts the direct URLs from rich HTML clipboard data.

5. Click **Add Links to Queue**. A prompt will appear allowing you to confirm the Batch Folder name so all main and optional files go to the exact same place.
6. Click **Select All** (or check individual boxes) for the files you want to download.
7. (Optional) Check the **Extract after download** checkbox if you want files extracted automatically using the built-in 7-Zip engine.
8. Click the green **Start / Resume** button to begin downloading.

9. Use the **Pause** and **Start / Resume** buttons to manage your selected downloads at any time.

### Download Scheduler
Queue your links, then let SilverSpoon download them automatically during a chosen window (e.g. off-peak hours):
1. Add and select your links as usual, but leave them **paused/queued** (don't press Start).
2. Open `File -> Download Scheduler` (or right-click one or more downloads and choose **Schedule download at specific interval** to schedule only those instead of the whole queue).
3. Set the **Start** and **End** times using the hour / minute / AM–PM dropdowns. If the end is earlier than the start, the window is treated as crossing midnight (e.g. `11:00 PM`–`5:00 AM`).
4. Choose **Repeat weekly** (and pick the active days) or **Run once** on a specific date.
5. *(Optional, Windows)* Tick **Wake the computer to run downloads** to register a Windows wake timer that powers the PC on and launches SilverSpoon when the window starts. Leave **Keep the computer awake** on so it doesn't sleep mid-download.
6. Click **Add Schedule**. When the window opens, SilverSpoon verifies your connection and starts the scheduled downloads; when it closes, it pauses them and shows a summary (also saved to `~/.silverspoon_offpeak_report.jsonl`).

> **Note:** The wake timer is Windows-only. On Linux/macOS the app still auto-starts and keeps the display awake while it is running, but it cannot power the machine on from a fully off state.
>
> **When using the wake timer, close SilverSpoon (or let the PC sleep) beforehand** so the timer launches a single fresh instance. SilverSpoon does not yet guard against multiple instances, and running two copies against the same queue can corrupt partially-downloaded files.

### Using the CLI
If you prefer the command line:
1. Put your links into `link.txt` (one per line).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python downloader.py link.txt
   ```
*(Files will be downloaded to the current working directory).*
